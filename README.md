Kubernetes for Developers

Okteto(https://okteto.com/) is a great tool and you don't need docker or k8s installed in your machine.
You don't even need now them. \
To start, you just need to install the Okteto CLI to use your preferred IDE and focus just on the code. \
Below are the steps to start with it.

Mac: `brew install okteto` \
Linux: `curl https://get.okteto.com -sSfL | sh` \
Windows: `scoop install okteto`

**Second step** \
To Log into it: `okteto login` \
_*Make sure you have an account there_

**Configuration** \
You just need an `okteto.yml` file with all the required configuration to the root directory of your application and the Okteto will take care of the rest. \
To run this application we need and MongoDB running, and you can use Okteto as well. Below are some pictures on how to do this.
